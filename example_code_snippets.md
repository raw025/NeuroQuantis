This snippet showcases three key functions for initializing high-speed data pathways, dynamic task allocation, and thermal management in a computing system leveraging cutting-edge materials like carbon nanotubes and graphene.

### Code Overview

1. **High-Speed Channel Initialization (`init_high_speed_channel`)**:
   - Configures a graphene-based high-speed bus.
   - Initializes carbon nanotube cores for enhanced processing.

2. **Dynamic Task Allocation (`dynamic_task_allocation`)**:
   - Dynamically assigns tasks based on speed requirements:
     - High-speed tasks are routed to the graphene layer.
     - Standard tasks are handled by regular cores.

3. **Thermal Management (`thermal_control`)**:
   - Monitors the system temperature.
   - Activates load redistribution and clock speed reduction when temperatures exceed safe limits.
