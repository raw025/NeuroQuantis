3. Simulation process and solver logs
•	Solver Settings:
o	Using a multi-core parallel iterative solver, 4 CPU cores perform parallel calculations
o	Each time step is 1e-03 seconds, and after 6119 iterations, the error of each iteration is about 1.02984e-16, which is highly accurate
o	The current distribution and magnetic field distribution are analyzed by solving the permeability versus the current density
•	Main calculation steps:
o	Matrix assembly: Each time step calculates the distribution of the magnetic field and current to construct a computational matrix
o	Force and torque calculations: In the process of calculating the current distribution, the action of the material is simulated in combination with electromagnetic forces
o	Electromagnetic loss: Analyze the electromagnetic loss by iterative solution of time step and current distribution

4. Simulation results and analysis
•	Current Distribution:
o	The current distribution results of graphene and carbon nanotubes in the electromagnetic field show that the current density of graphene is relatively high, indicating that its conductivity is superior.
o	In carbon nanotubes, the current distribution of single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes is also different, with single-walled carbon nanotubes having a greater current density and showing better conductivity.
•	Magnetic field distribution:
o	Graphene exhibits strong diamagnetism, and the magnetic field is almost impenetrable, which is consistent with the characteristics of superconductors.
o	The magnetic response of carbon nanotubes under the applied magnetic field is weak, but there is still a certain magnetic field shielding effect, especially multi-walled carbon nanotubes.
•	Electromagnetic Loss:
o	Graphene has low losses in electromagnetic fields and shows its superior high-frequency performance.
o	The electromagnetic loss of carbon nanotubes is high, especially under high-frequency electromagnetic fields, and the loss value increases significantly.

5. Conclusion
•	Graphene: It has super conductivity and diamagnetism, and is suitable for high-frequency electromagnetic applications, such as electromagnetic wave shielding and conductive materials. The simulation results verify the advantages of low loss and high conductivity. 
•	Carbon nanotubes: exhibit good electrical conductivity in electromagnetic environments, especially single-walled carbon nanotubes, but are slightly inferior to graphene in terms of electromagnetic loss. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes have a certain magnetic field shielding ability and are suitable for some electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding occasions.
