Graphene Heat Transfer Test Report (554 minutes)
1. Project Background
Graphene, known for its exceptional thermal conductivity, is widely used in efficient heat dissipation, electronic cooling, and advanced chip architectures (such as NeuroQuantis) for thermal management systems. The objective of this test was to evaluate graphene's heat transfer properties over a 554-minute timescale, and to analyze temperature stability and heat transfer efficiency.
