NeuroQuantis Brain-inspired chip architecture design framework

1. Core objectives
NeuroQuantis is a chip architecture design focused on brain-inspired computing, which aims to achieve ultra-efficient resource management and computing power by simulating the distributed operation of biological neural networks. The framework provides core design principles and functional modules, but does not limit the specific implementation method, providing developers with maximum freedom and flexibility.

2. Frame design concept
1. Modularity & Flexibility:
 -  The chip architecture adopts a modular design, allowing users to dynamically adjust resource allocation and module configuration according to application scenarios. 
   - Key modules (e.g., AI core, tensor computing unit) can be adapted to different computing needs.  

2. Adaptive Resource Management:
   - Integrate the AI core module for real-time monitoring, scheduling, and optimal resource allocation. 
   - Ensure maximum efficiency in multitasking, highly parallel computing scenarios.  

3. **Material & Process Support**:
   - Based on carbon nanotubes and graphene materials, it realizes high-performance computing and low-power consumption. 
 - Supports processes such as  PECVD, EUV lithography, and more, with the goal of  achieving manufacturing accuracy in the 1-2nm range. 

4. **Decentralized Computing**:
   - A distributed computing architecture that simulates biological neurons to optimize low-latency signaling and dynamic learning.

3. Functional modules
1. **AI Core Module**:
   - Functions: Responsible for resource scheduling, task optimization, and dynamic adaptation. 
   - Feature: Optimize computation paths with real-time analytics and deep learning. 

2. Tensor Computation Unit (TCU):
   - Function: Efficiently handle matrix operations and deep learning inference tasks. 
 -  Feature: Code-level control can be achieved in combination with a micro AI module. 

3. Dynamic Storage Snap-in (DSMU):
   - Function: Manage temporary storage and scheduling of data. 
   - Features: Allocate bandwidth and storage resources based on demand. 

4. Brain-like Signal Processing Unit (NBSPU):
   - Function: Simulate neuronal signaling and support parallel computing. 
   - Features: Low power consumption, low latency, and strong adaptability.

4. How to use the framework
1. **Design Principles**:
   - The framework only provides high-level architectural design and does not contain detailed implementation solutions. 
   - Users need to design specific implementation solutions according to their own needs (such as hardware design or software algorithms of core modules). 

2. **Applicable Scenario**:
   - Supercomputers, high-end AI systems, space exploration missions. 
   - Scenarios that require highly parallel computing and dynamic learning capabilities. 

3. **User Responsibility**:
   - Users can customize the framework based on it, and how to use the framework depends entirely on the needs and capabilities of the developer. 
   - Frameworks are not bound by specific design or implementation methods.

5. Statement of Openness
The framework design of NeuroQuantis is designed to provide a common reference for brain-inspired computing architectures, without any constraints on specific implementation paths. Developers are free to be creative and use it in any area that meets the goals of the app. How to implement and use this framework is entirely determined by the capabilities and needs of the developer.
